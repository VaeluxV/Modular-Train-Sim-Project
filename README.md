# Modular-Train-Sim-Project
A modular train sim cab project made for arduino. Communicating internally using painlessmesh, the main Arduino/Microcontroller requires HID capability (You can use a Pro Mico, Leonardo, etc. for this). The secondary/remote microcontroller has to support FreeRTOS meaning only chips such as an ESP32 will be supported. 

This is still work in progress. **Currently unfinished**.
